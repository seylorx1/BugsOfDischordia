# Beats of Dischordia Issue Tracker

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/seylorx1/BugsOfDischordia/releases/) for the latest build versions.

## Creating an Issue
Creating an issue works exactly like it would on any other GitHub repo through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/seylorx1/BugsOfDischordia/issues). However, this repo is partially integrated with our internal Jira. Make sure any new issues are assigned with the `Jira` tag. Please also note that any updates made to the issue after publishing *will not* be reflected in the Jira, so try your best to ensure everything's alright before submitting (although don't worry too much if you make a mistake! Just pop a URL to the Issue in the Discord if there are any issues and we'll update it internally.)

We will update Issues tab whenever a bug is updated on our end too, so you'll always have the most up-to-date info!

## Documentation
We're following Agile development practices with a focus on ensuring features are added and maintained throughout development, rather than a focus on documentation. Documentation is there, but it's not always up to date. If you have any queries, drop a message on the Discord and we'll get back to you as soon as we can!
